I will be evaluating Homebrew again this week, this time to navigate the license and development setup.

###Licensing

Redistribution is allowed if: it also contains the license and copyright notice. It also absolves Homebrew of liability and warranty.

This extremely simplified license (called the BSD 2-clause license) gives other developers flexibility on how Homebrew can be used, so long as it doesn't breach the two conditions above. Developers can modify, redistribute, and even use it commercially. Companies can even use Homebrew for proprietary software.

###Setup Instructions

THe instructions to set up development environment is quite easy: you need Homebrew installed already. The rest of the setup includes detailed instructions on forking and creating a remote repository, which concludes the development environment setup. I only have one criticism: that there isn't a link for new developers to actually download Homebrew, although I can see why maintainers would assume someone developing for Homebrew would have it installed already.

The rest of the instructions detail how to test changes and create pull requests.
