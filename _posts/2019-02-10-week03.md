My team created an open source Firefox extension for NYU students, with convenient links to Albert and Classes and weather data in the form of gifs.

I was able to get the extension to display a message upon opening a new tab, and added links and an HTTP request to the GIPHY API. Some work we have left to do is: request weather data and then render a gif that is relevant to the current weather, and some CSS styling!

Our project was ambitious compared to other teams', since we opted to use two API endpoints. Although I am glad we have some interesting results, it is still a work in progress.

In terms of git, I learned to add an upstream repo!
