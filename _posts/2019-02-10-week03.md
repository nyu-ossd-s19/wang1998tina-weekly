Our browser extension, mood, was an interesting foray into creating our first open source project. 

Ashley, Candace, and I did not meet up in person to work on mood, but we kept a Facebook group chat and regularly checked Github to review each other's PRs and issues. Working remotely can have its issues (I had an internship where I was a 12 hour time difference from my supervisor, and that was very difficult), but we mostly did not encounter major merge conflicts and worked on our own separate parts. We kept each other in the loop about what we were doing.

In class, we had gone over a lot of the requirements together and were able to work accordingly. Candace created a great design to fit all our requirements, and we are currently working towards polishing the UI.
