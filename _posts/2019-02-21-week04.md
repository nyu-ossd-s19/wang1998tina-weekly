title: open source project evaluation
---

Homebrew was an ideal choice for me as a project of interest. I wanted to work with software that I've used and will use in the future, and with a community that is friendly to newcomers. It also is written in Ruby, a language I've been meaning to learn for awhile.

Here is a thorough evaluation of the project:
