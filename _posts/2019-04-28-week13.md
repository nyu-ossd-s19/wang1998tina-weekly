I appreciated the dynamics in which our team functioned. We were mostly all pulling the same amount of weight in finding, flagging, and working on issues. There was also minimal friction and the four of us got along well. There was good synergy in that we all took initiative to work on issues, and there was not as much imbalance in contributions.

In terms of my own contributions to the team, the specific details are listed in the class wiki. I made code contributions, commented and opened new issues, and also submitted PRs. When we started to run out of issues, I scoured the freeCodeCamp platform to personally find one that we could proactively solve. As someone who is a little more comfortable with git (although still rusty), I was also able to make fixes when people were pushing to master accidentally, among other git issues.
