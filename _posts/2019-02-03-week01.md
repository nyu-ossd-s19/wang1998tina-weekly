title: First Week!

We had a great first week in this course! I've always been interested in working in this realm, but have never stumbled into a good starting point. 

#### What is open source?

In my own thinking, open source is a way to provide software for anyone to use or modify themselves. Contributors generally work at these projects out of interest and not as a steady paycheck (although there are some that do get paid).

Open source is transparent, free, and resistant to the rising trend of proprietary software. It uplifts marginalized communities that don't have the resources to afford expensive software. It allows software creators to be accountable to stakeholders.

#### My favorite open source projects

- __Wikipedia__. Although not source code based, Wikipedia functions as an open source project for documenting and spreading knowledge. I love that it doesn't rely on ads and its work to make information accessible and clear.
- __Vue.js__, a JavaScript framework for creating user interfaces. I've had a great experience with this project in the past. 
- __Atom__. This is my second favorite text editor (after Sublime!)
- __Linux__. The Linux operating system includes supporting libraries created by GNU itself. Also I love the mascot.
