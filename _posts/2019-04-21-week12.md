In the Kevin Fleming talk this week, something I found especially fascinating was his discussion on how Bloomberg's systems have to handle client traffic. He mentioned the principles of "volume, velocity, veracity", meaning that clients often need information on a large amount of queries very quickly (within 1.5ms), and that the data needs to be accurate and relevant. The systems also need to be able to handle special situations, such as spikes in requests or server failures. This summer, I'm going to be working on resource efficiency and analysing a large network (with billions of users) for health and performance, so that was a great insight.

In terms of our group project, we've been moving through our issues. I've helped finish an issue on solutions for various sorting algorithms (which was a good practice in recalling things I hoped I'd never encounter again!), but has not been in a PR since we're still testing locally. Also, all four of us have collaborated on writing a challenge teaching recursion, so hopefully a PR will be sent out this week for that as well. This coming week, we'll finish those two up and then try to find new ones to tackle. The work we've done lately has been a great practice in Javascript as well.
